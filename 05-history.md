If we want to see what we changed at different steps, we can use `git diff`
again, but with the notation `HEAD~1`, `HEAD~2`, and so on, to refer to old
commits:

~~~ {.bash}
$ git diff HEAD~1 mars.txt
~~~
~~~ {.output}
diff --git a/mars.txt b/mars.txt
index 315bf3a..b36abfd 100644
--- a/mars.txt
+++ b/mars.txt

In this way,
we can build up a chain of commits.
The most recent end of the chain is referred to as `HEAD`;
we can refer to previous commits using the `~` notation,
so `HEAD~1` (pronounced "head minus one")
means "the previous commit",
while `HEAD~123` goes back 123 commits from where we are now.

We can also refer to commits using
those long strings of digits and letters
that `git log` displays.
These are unique IDs for the changes,
and "unique" really does mean unique:
every change to any set of files on any computer
has a unique 40-character identifier.
Our first commit was given the ID
f22b25e3233b4645dabd0d81e651fe074bd8e73b,
so let's try this:

~~~ {.bash}
$ git diff f22b25e3233b4645dabd0d81e651fe074bd8e73b mars.txt
~~~
~~~ {.output}
diff --git a/mars.txt b/mars.txt

That's the right answer,
but typing out random 40-character strings is annoying,
so Git lets us use just the first few characters:

~~~ {.bash}
$ git diff f22b25e mars.txt
~~~
~~~ {.output}
diff --git a/mars.txt b/mars.txt
index df0654a..b36abfd 100644

Instead of finding what has changed since a commit, we can show what has changed in
only one commit by using `git show`:

~~~ {.bash}
$ git show f22b25e
~~~
~~~ {.output}

    Start notes on Mars as a base

Running `git show` without any arguments is the same as `git show HEAD`,
showing you the most recent commit very quickly:

~~~ {.bash}
$ git show
~~~
~~~ {.output}
