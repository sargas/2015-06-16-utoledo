## Installing Git
Do not hesitate to [email](mailto:joe@neoturbine.net) if there are any issues or concerns you run into.

### Linux
Install Git using the packages from your package manager ("Software Center" or "Add/Remove Software"). The Git project has [instructions](https://git-scm.com/download/linux) to do this from the command line for many popular distributions.

### Mac OS X
Running `git` from the terminal should prompt you to install Xcode Command Line Tools, Apple's distribution of useful utilities. If your system is too old to obtain Xcode for free, an official installer is [available](https://git-scm.com/download/mac).

### Windows
[msysGit](https://msysgit.github.io/) provides a command line environment for using Git in Windows. [GitHub for Windows](https://windows.github.com/) is an alternative distribution of Git that includes PowerShell integration, if you make use of that in Windows.

## Signing up for GitHub
[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a website for easy sharing and collaborating on projects using Git. It is not needed to use Git, but will be used in the second half of the workshop (so [register](https://github.com/join) when possible). Their business model is to allow unlimited public repositories, and charge for the use of their site for private repositories. Students get a number of [perks](https://education.github.com/pack), including five private repositories.
